== Success Stories ==

> “We have a fairly high close percentage. Of those who contact us via Olark, our close rate is more than 40%!" - AJ Levinson, CEO of BottleLess.com
>
> “Since we started using Olark, there's definitely a more manageable flow of inquiries. We have more time available to spend on the phone with complex/larger inquiries and a reduction in people phoning to ask something simple like the delivery charge or stock levels. We can put more time into closing an order for, say, £2500, rather than stuck on the phone with a few people making £50 orders."
